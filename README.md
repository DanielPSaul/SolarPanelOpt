**Description:** With this simple solar panel optimization calculator, users enter an anlysis period, panel, electricity, and demand inputs then outputs the total cost of the solar project, optimal number of panels, and purchased kWh per analysis year. The results can be adjusted based on new panel energy generatiion and downloaded to an Excel file. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.
